            <h3>The great city of Ibadan</h3>
            <p>
                Ibadan is the capital and most populous city of Oyo State, Nigeria with Its population of 2,550,593
                according to 2006 census results, includes 11 local government areas. It is the third-most populous city
                in Nigeria and the largest city in the country by geographical area.
                <br>
                The economic activities of Ibadan include agriculture, commerce, handicrafts, manufacturing, and service
                industries. Although the city’s farming population has declined, it is still large for an urban area.
                Many cultivators are part-time farmers who augment their earnings with other work.
                <br>
                The city of Ibadan is naturally drained by four rivers with many tributaries: Ona River in the North and
                West; Ogbere River towards the East; Ogunpa River flowing through the city and Kudeti River in the
                Central part of the metropolis. Ogunpa River, a third-order stream with a channel length of 12.76 km and
                a catchment area of 54.92 km2. Lake Eleyele is located at the northwestern part of the city, while the
                Osun River and the Asejire Lake bound the city to the east.

                Holmes and Watson's investigations take them across London. Sherlock
                deduces that West was murdered elsewhere, then moved to ibadan
                Station to create the illusion that he was crushed on the tracks by
                a train. On their way to Woolwich Sherlock dispatches a telegram to
                Mycroft at London Bridge: "Send list of all foreign spies known to
                be in England, with full address."

                While investigating at Woolwich Arsenal Sherlock learns that West
                did not have the three keys&mdash;door, office, and
                safe&mdash;necessary to steal the papers. The train station clerk
                mentions seeing an agitated West boarding the 8:15 train to London
                Bridge. Sherlock suspects West of following someone who had access
                to the Woolwich chief's keyring with all three keys.

                Mycroft responds to Sherlock's telegram and mentions several spies.
                Hugo Oberstein of 13 Caulfield Gardens catches Sherlock's eye. He
                heads to the nearby Gloucester Road station to investigate and
                learns that the windows of Caulfield Gardens open over rail tracks
                where trains stop frequently.

                Holmes deduces that the murderer placed West atop a stopped train at
                Caulfield Gardens. The train traveled to ibadan Station before
                West's body finally toppled off. Backtracking to the criminal's
                apartment, Holmes finds a series of classified ads from
                <em>The Daily Telegraph</em> stashed away. All are under the name
                Pierrot: "Monday night after nine. Two taps. Only ourselves. Do not
                be so suspicious. Payment in hard cash when goods delivered."

                Holmes and Watson head to The Daily Telegraph and place an ad to
                draw out the criminal. It reads: "To-night. Same hour. Same place.
                Two taps. Most vitally important. Your own safety at stake.
                Pierrot." The trap works and Holmes catches the criminal: Colonel
                Valentine Walter, the brother of Woolwich Arsenal's chief. He
                confesses to working for Hugo Oberstein to obtain the submarine
                plans in order to pay off his debts.

                for the submarine in exchange for money. The plan works and Holmes
